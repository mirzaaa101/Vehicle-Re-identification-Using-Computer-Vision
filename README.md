# Vehicle-Re-identification-Using-Computer-Vision
Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging computer vision task that aims to match vehicle images captured from non-overlapping camera views. The goal is to identify the same vehicle instance across multiple camera views, which can be useful for traffic management and law enforcement applications. Vehicle Re-ID has several challenges, including variations in viewpoint, illumination, occlusion, and camera hardware differences. Researchers have proposed various approaches to tackle these challenges, including deep learning-based methods that leverage powerful feature representations to match similar vehicles. The performance of vehicle Re-ID has improved significantly in recent years, but it remains an active area of research due to its practical importance and technical difficulty. The purpose of this coursework is to gain real-world development experience in design, training, and evaluation of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for vehicle Re-ID. This will be achieved through the Google Colab with PyTorch as the framework.
